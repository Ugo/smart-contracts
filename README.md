# Smart-contracts

This is a directory of small Dapps that have been developped to get familiar with solidity and the web3 environment. The frontend is done with react and the bootstrap library.

Here you will find several dapps:
- [Multsig wallet](https://github.com/Ugo/smart-contracts/tree/main/multisig): a simple implementation of a multisig dapp.
- [Escrow dapp](https://github.com/Ugo/smart-contracts/tree/main/escrow): a dapp that requires a payer to pay some money that will be released by a lawyer once the needed amount is reached.
- [Decentralized exchange](https://github.com/Ugo/smart-contracts/tree/main/dex): a simple implementation of a dex that supports 3 currencies on top of a base currency (here DAI). The dex supports limit and market orders.
