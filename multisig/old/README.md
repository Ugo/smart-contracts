# Multisig

This dapp is a simple multisig contract.
During deployment of the contract, the list of approvers and the minimum number of approvers for the multisig is set. By default, here it will be 2.

A transaction can be initiated but it will require the approval of at least 2 approvers before being sent. Here is a screenshot of what approvers will see:
